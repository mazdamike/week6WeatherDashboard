Week 6 homework - Weather Dashboard

This app retrieves the weather for cities entered by the user. It obtains temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index with various API calls. It also obtains a five-day forecast for the city. Once entered, the city and its weather data are stored and formed into a list, and when one of the cities in the list is clicked the weather for that city is retrieved from storage.

A screenshot is included in the repository.

A [link to the app in GitHub pages](https://mazdamike.github.io/week6WeatherDashboard/) is included here.
